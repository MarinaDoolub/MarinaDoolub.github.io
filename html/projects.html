                <p>
                    This project is a simple calculator built using Python's Tkinter library. 
                    It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations.The calculator features a graphical user interface (GUI) that includes buttons for digits and operations, 
                    making it user-friendly. It also handles basic error checking, such as division by zero.
                    The calculator's interface is designed to be intuitive, with buttons laid out in a grid format. 
                    Users can click on the buttons to input numbers and operations, and the result is displayed in a text field.
                    The calculator also includes a clear button to reset the input and an exit button to close the application.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The calculator supports the following operations:
                </p>

                    What I Learned
                </h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Through building my calculator app in Python, 
                    I’ve learned how to create graphical user interfaces using the tkinter library and 
                    structure a program using event-driven programming.
                    I gained hands-on experience with functions, error handling using try-except,
                    and integrating Python’s built-in math module for advanced operations like 
                    square roots and squaring. I also learned how to manage user input, dynamically update
                    the interface, and improve the user experience through thoughtful design choices. 
                    This project helped me connect core Python concepts with practical application, 
                    deepening my understanding of how software tools are built from the ground up.

                <p>
                    This project involves creating and managing a SQL database to store and retrieve data efficiently. 
                    I designed a library database that is designed to manage a library's book inventory,
                    member information, and borrowing records. The database includes tables for books, members, and loan transactions.
                    I created multiple relational tables with primary and foreign keys to establish relationships between the data,
                    implemented SQL queries to perform operations such as adding new books, updating member information, 
                    and tracking book loans.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The database supports the following functionalities:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Adding new books to the inventory</li>
                        <li>Updating member information</li>
                        <li>Tracking book loans and returns</li>
                        <li>Generating reports on book availability and member activity</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <br>
                <p>
                    Through this project, I learned how to design and implement a relational database using SQL. 
                    I gained experience in creating tables, defining relationships, and
                    writing complex queries to manipulate and retrieve data.
                    I also learned about normalization and how to structure data efficiently to minimize redundancy.
                    This project helped me understand the importance of database management systems in 
                    handling large volumes of data and ensuring data integrity.
