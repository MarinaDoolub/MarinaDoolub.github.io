                <p>
                    I began my journey studying science with the intention of becoming a doctor.
                    While that path didn’t unfold as planned, it led me to something unexpected:
                    a genuine interest in coding. 
                    Encouraged by my brother, I started learning about different programming languages
                    — and quickly realized I enjoyed solving problems and building things with code.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I'm currently deepening my knowledge in computer science with the goal of entering
                    Middlesex University to study their Computer Science course and
                    become an AI engineer.
                    I've taken the initiative to teach myself Python, SQL, and HTML & CSS, 
                    and I enjoy exploring how these tools can be used to solve real-world problems 
                    through technology.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I love the challenge of coding and the satisfaction that comes from creating something functional and useful.
                    Whether it’s building a simple calculator or analyzing data with SQL, 
                    I find joy in the process of learning and improving my skills.
                </p>
                <br>    
                <p>
                    When I’m not coding, you can find me reading about the latest tech trends, experimenting with new programming languages, or enjoying a good book.
                    I’m excited to continue this journey and see where 
                    it takes me next!

                    I have worked on a few projects that showcase
                    my skills in Python, SQL, and web development.
                    You can find my projects on my <a href="projects.html">Projects</a>
                    page, where I share details about each project and the technologies used.

                    From 2017 to 2024,i attended Seewa Bappoo Secondary School, where I completed
                    my O-Levels and A-Levels.
                    My next step is university, where I aim to deepen my understanding of 
                    software development and explore new areas in computer science.
